# icp-identicon

This is a simple Typescript Express project that is an identicon generator using the caller principal, and optionally a salted (with ic.time()) identicon (should be mostly unique).

Minimally viable ICP project just to test out a minimally functional Azle project with no stable storage, using a basic Express server setup.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
dfx deploy
```
